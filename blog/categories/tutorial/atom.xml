    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve found a great tool that belongs to a context I&rsquo;ve not been interested until now. Lately me and my coworkers team in <a href="http://www.mymalcom.com">Malcom</a> have been involved in dev-ops work. Connecting to many servers at the same time to look into logs, editing scripts, configurations, etc. is a everyday work. I used to launch terminals and handling them separately. Not anymore.</p>

<p>Here <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">Tmux</a> comes to us to give a hand. It&rsquo;s a terminal multiplexer letting you run various TTYs in the same terminal window.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are two main behaviours to work with it, windows and panes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows behaviour lets you have various terminals in a unique terminal like tabs in a browser.</li>
<li>Pane behaviour lets you split the current window into panes.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s go to work a little bit with it. Easy to install as usual thanks to <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> (only if you are in a Mac). If so, type in your terminal the following:</p>

<p><code>
brew install tmux
</code>
Now you can start up tmux. You know you are in tmux because you will see a green status bar that indicates where are you.</p>

<p><code>
tmux
</code>
You need to know tmux uses an action binding key <code>Ctrl + b</code> which you&rsquo;ll need to do any action you want. Start creating a new window with <code>Ctrl+b c</code>. Now you are in a second window if you want to go back to the previous window <code>Ctrl+b p</code>. Let&rsquo;s play with this keybindings list:</p>

<p><code>
Ctrl+b c Create new window
Ctrl+b n Move to the next window
Ctrl+b p Move to the previous window
Ctrl+b &amp; Kill the current window
Ctrl+b , Rename the current window
Ctrl+b ? List all keybindings
</code>
But tmux supports another powerful feature, the second behaviour I mentioned: panes. You can split any window to panes, vertically and horizontally. Try with <code>Ctrl+b %</code> and you split the windows vertically. If you can move through panes you can use <code>Ctrl+b o</code> to go next pane. But again play with this keybindings list:</p>

<p><code>
Ctrl+b % Split the window vertically
Ctrl+b : Split the window horizontally
Ctrl+b o Goto next pane
Ctrl+b q Show pane numbers, when the numbers show up type the key to goto that pane
Ctrl+b { Move the current pane left
Ctrl+b } Move the current pane right
</code></p>

<p>There are a lot of keybindings for an advance use, like moving windows, resize panes, make panes into an own window, but you can see all these options in <code>Ctrl+b ?</code>. Help yourself.</p>

<p>At last but not least tmux can detach the whole session and re-attach it again if you want to.</p>

<p><code>
Ctrl+b d        Detach from currently attached session
tmux attach -d  re-attach an attached session (detaching it from elsewhere)
tmux attach     re-attach an attached session (keeping it attached elsewhere)
</code>
For sure it&rsquo;s not a hot technology but my ignorance about this kind of tool and how tmux does its job deserves a notable mention.</p>
