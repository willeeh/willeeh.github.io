Here I am.

I've proposed to myself blog something interesting every week at least. And you got a metapost here.

After seeing  [mrmans0n](http://nlopez.io/) doing some great stuff with Octopress (blogging framework I'm using in this blog), I wanted to give it a try and see how well was. 

So good so far. Its documentation is pretty well, its simplicity is very sexy and deploying it on Github pages straight forward. But I miss some useful tools like remove posts not published yet. If I get used to work with Octopress, I will contribute this kind of tools.

In coming posts I promise to go deep into great stuff I'm working on.
