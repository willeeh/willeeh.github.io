    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I was working on an app to allow users to look for fast food restaurants in Spain. Actually, the app is pretty much done but I&rsquo;ve not published yet because of some minor design details. I&rsquo;m that kind of a good-eye guy who doesn&rsquo;t want to show the world the product til it&rsquo;s amazing, but I&rsquo;m becoming more <em>lean</em> lately.</p>

<p>I made a web scraper to get fast food restaurants info (as location, name, image,…) and then put into a database (I used MongoHQ btw). So, this weekend I uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/willeeh/food-franchises-geojson">code</a> to GitHub.</p>

<p>You can think: it&rsquo;s not a big deal anyway, so why &mdash;this boring&mdash; guy is talking about this?</p>

<p>Here we go… GitHub has launched a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that">good feature</a> to visualize geographic data, using <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>, <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. Ten days after this announcement they&rsquo;ve improved this feature letting <a href="https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements">large data sets to be grouped automatically</a>. Wonderful work!</p>

<p>That day I had no doubts I would use my code to generate GeoJSON to visualize fast food restaurants in Spain.</p>

<p>What do you think about this result?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Here I am. </h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve proposed to myself blog something interesting every week at least. And you got a metapost here.</p>

<p>After seeing  <a href="http://nlopez.io/">mrmans0n</a> doing some great stuff with Octopress (blogging framework I&rsquo;m using in this blog), I wanted to give it a try and see how well was.</p>

<p>So good so far. Its documentation is pretty well, its simplicity is very sexy and deploying it on Github pages straight forward. But I miss some useful tools like remove posts not published yet. If I get used to work with Octopress, I will contribute this kind of tools.</p>

<p>In coming posts I promise to go deep into great stuff I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
